				<span class="gencontent__title">What is the TOEFL?</span>
				<span class="gencontent__desc">Before you can apply to a U.S. college, international students first have to meet the English language requirements for admission to demonstrate that they can use English in an academic setting.  The Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) is used by over 11,000 universities and, more importantly, it is preferred by 9 out of 10 American universities. The minimum scores vary from school to school and also between undergraduate and graduate students. It can be a very long and intensive process to prepare for the TOEFL. Thanks to BEIâ€™s University Partnerships, we will arm you with everything you need to apply to U.S. colleges and universities without having to take the dreaded TOEFL exam.</span>
