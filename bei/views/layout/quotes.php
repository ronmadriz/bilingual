					<p>Before you can apply to a U.S. college, international students first have to meet the English language requirements for admission to demonstrate that they can use English in an academic setting.  The Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) is used by over 11,000 universities and, more importantly, it is preferred by 9 out of 10 American universities. The minimum scores vary from school to school and also between undergraduate and graduate students. It can be a very long and intensive process to prepare for the TOEFL. Thanks to BEI’s University Partnerships, we will arm you with everything you need to apply to U.S. colleges and universities without having to take the dreaded TOEFL exam.</p>
